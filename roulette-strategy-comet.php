          Comet is recommended for people who want to play only few spins on roulette. It is a little predictable system, but with a bit of luck it can positively surprise us. All our simulations were tested on <a href="https://www.skyvegas.com/?aff=1197317075&open=login" target="_blank">sky vegas roulette</a>.  </p>

          <li> The method of placing chips is shown below.

            We put 1 chip on full number 5 and 32. Also we put £1 on each squere: 
            <ul>
              <li>3, 6, 2, 5</li>
              <li>6, 9, 5, 8</li>
              <li>2, 5, 1, 4</li>
              <li>5, 8, 4, 7</li>
              <li>33, 36, 32, 35</li>
            </ul>

          </li>
         
          <li>  As you can see, we cover 13 numbers of roulette, more than 1/3.
           The most profitable field is 5 (£72 - £7 of profit), then 32 (£41-7£). The numbers 2, 4, 6, 8 win £18 - £7 = £11. Fields 1, 3, 7, 9, 33, 35, 36 give us £ 9 - £ 7 = £2.
          </li>
          <li>
            We play 4 spins - if all are empty propose to finish the game and return to it another time.If we won 1 or more spins we continue the game. Watch your capital. If you lose more than £ 30, finish the game.  <br>
            <strong>A happy series can bring you a good profit in a very short time!</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            SUMMARY: Comet is a system designed for people with £ 30 and ready to take the risk of losing them in a few minutes or winning £ 100. Both the risk of losing and the potential win are large.
