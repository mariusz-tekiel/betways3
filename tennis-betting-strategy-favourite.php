          In tennis much more often than in other disciplines the favorites win their matches. It is an extremely prestigious and profitable sport. ATP and WTP statistics are much more reliable than, for example, soccer statistics. Tennis as an individual sport is easier to be estimated by bookmakers. 
          Our strategy is to bet on individual bets of the favorite. We can conveniently place bets of this kind in

          <li> We choose tennis games, where the  favorite odd is between 1.45-1.65. We recommend this range because the favorite must be distinct and at the same time the odd high enough to give us a profit.

          <li>After placing our favorite, we wait for the result and then we 
           choose the next match. In order to ensure continuity of profit, we can apply progressions, e.g. 1, 2, 4.
