          <strong>All our analyzes are about European roulette.   
            We will not deal with American roulette because it has two zero holes - 0 and 00, which means that it is unnecessarily increasing the probability of our failure. <br>
          </strong> All roulette simulations we can practice using <a href="https://www.skyvegas.com/?aff=1197317075&open=login" target="_blank">sky vegas roulette</a>. Minimal spin bet there is only 1 penny. Minimal deposit 5£. <br> <br>       
          Originally, martingale was one of basic classes of betting strategies that was popular in 18th-century France.

        <ol>
          <li> We start the system by betting 1£ on colour e.g. red. If we lose, we double the bet - £2 on red. If we lose again, double the bet, etc. If we win, we start from the beginning, that is from the lowest rate.
          </li>

          <li>The following example, based on real data, shows the development of the game in the Martingale system.

                  <figcaption>I recommend to use this system with limit of stake for example £16. Otherwise, the system may be too risky.</figcaption>
                </figure>
              </div>
            </div>

          </li>
          <li>Where is the trap then? Theoretically, it is always a winning 
            system. Practice turns out to be completely different. 
            Martingale will always win, but only if there are two conditions - unlimited player capital and unlimited playing time. In fact, not many of us have unlimited capital and the time of the game is subject to certain restrictions.
          </li>

          <li>Let's imagine the case when Red doesn't come up for 10 spins in a row. Table bellow shows how much money you will lose having so unlucky sequence - £1023.
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-xl-5 mx-auto">

                  <figcaption>This is not a rare thing at all. I have seen the series many times when the reds have not been scored for 10, 20 or even more spins.</figcaption>

            SUMMARY: The Martingale is a very popular betting system, therefore it has been described here. However, we warn against its excessive use. With an unlucky series, it can become a real trap.
