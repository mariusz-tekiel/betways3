            <p>Another system we would like to present uses Half Time / Full Time bets.  </p>




            <ol>
               <li> First of all, we should review statistical data on individual leagues. The table bellow shows the results we collected. I remind you that the data can change after each league match. It's good to use the latest data.
                  <div class="row">
                     <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-xl-6 mx-auto">
                        <figure>
                          <img id="football-half-fulltime-board1" class="home-pic" style="text-align:center;" src="images/football-half-fulltime-board1.PNG" alt="football half-full time strategy board1" height="300" width="100%">
                           <figcaption>Statistical table showing the most common half / full time events in individual leagues.  </figcaption>
                        </figure>
                     </div>
                  </div>
               </li>
               <li>We choose the match, in our case Lazio - Inter. We take 2 the most common Half / Full Time results for the Italian Serie A - 1/1 and x/1. Then we create 2 Dutched bets using <a href="https://www.aceodds.com/bet-calculator/dutching.html" target="_blank">Dutching Calculator</a> 

                  <div class="row">
                     <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-xl-6 mx-auto">
                        <figure>
                           <img id="football1-pic2" class="home-pic" src="images/football-half-fulltime-board2.PNG" alt="football 4matches4bets strategy board2" height="120" width="100%">
                           <figcaption>Thanks to this type of bets, we can easily track this system and control its results.</figcaption>

                     </div>
                  </div>


               </li>
              

               <li>Here is a short list of games with this system. We do not recommend any specific progression. Everyone should adjust the amount of rates to his possibilities and expectations.

                  <div class="row">
                     <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-xl-6 mx-auto">
                        <figure>
                           <img id="football1-pic3" class="home-pic" src="images/football-half-fulltime-board3.PNG" alt="football game history table" height="350px" width="100%">
                           <figcaption>History of few games. Column 0 shows money balance.</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                     </div>
                  </div>


               </li>
               <li>
                  SUMMARY: The above system is very safe. Many people use it with 3-stage progression. Be sure to use the current data when selecting the bet.
               </li>
