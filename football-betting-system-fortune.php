       <p>Fortune system does not require great football knowledge and brings quite interesting results. The method of betting may seem troublesome at first, but with some experience it is not a problem.</p>
       <ol>
         <li> We choose 5 football matches. We try to find odds on Home win within the range 1.5 - 1.9

         <li>We place 6 bets according to the table below.

           <li>Please do not choose friendly matches or not prestigious leagues. </li>

                EXAMPLE: We put £1 for every singular bet, so spend £6. We can use Martingale progressions - 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 ... The average frequency of wins is about 1/5. Here is a list of several games played with this system.

                </div>
           </li>

         <li>The system only goes below zero for the first 4 games. Then he stays firmly above.

            SUMMARY: As you can see the Fortune system is quite profitable. As with every system, it has its weak points, so it's best to start with low rates.
