        <p>"...Traditionally betting has occurred between a customer and a bookmaker where the customer 'backs' (bets that an outcome will occur) and the bookmaker 'lays' (bets that the outcome will not occur). Betting exchanges offer the opportunity for anyone to both back and lay..." - Wikipedia. <br> 
          The system that we want to present this time is based on the use of  Lay option (<a href="https://promotions.betfair.com/exchange-acq-uk-bau-free20-val225-cta?rfr=990225&gclid=CjwKCAiAgrfhBRA3EiwAnfF4toKEK7ExS0jQY1p_dvkPJzSYVzY164d78mXe7JkNKoU7S9L6CNvkPBoCTeYQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank">Betfair Exchange</a>).</p>
      <ol> 
        <li>We choose a horse that does not seem to be a winner in our opinion, and its Lay odd is in the range of 5 - 7. It is also important that at least 2 other horses particpating in race have smaller Lay odds. In our case, we choose horse no 1 Verne Castle with the Lay odd 6.2.

        <li>We set Backer's Stake £5, what gives us Liability £26.

                <figcaption>Please choose horses carefully. Let's skip the races that inspires our doubts. With appropriate experience, we are able to get quite long series of winnings in row.</figcaption>

        <li>Someone will ask - We risk £ 26 to win £ 5? Yes, but if we look at the 
         probability of winning, we will see that it is very high. Remember, we lose only when Verne Castle wins the race. Winning every other horse is our win.  
        </li>
         
        <li>The presented method of playing has a bonus. Very often, we can earn 
          money before the race begins.
          Let's pay attention to the rate we had half an hour before the race (Verne Castle - Back 5.9,  Lay 6.2 ). This is still the moment when horses are not presented in public, so you can not judge their condition on the basis of appearance and way of moving.
          <br>Below are the rates for 5 minutes before the start of the race.

                <figcaption>As you can see, the Back odd is now 11.5, which is higher than Lay we have bet before. Betfair will allow us to cash out the average profit now.</figcaption>

        <li> If the Betfair offer does not satisfy us, we can create a so-called 
          Green Book, a completely safe bet. Putting £ 28 on Verne Castle Back (11.5), we get a bet where we win a few pounds in the case of Verne Castle win. Otherwise we do not lose any money.
        </li>

            SUMMARY: Lay the Loser is a nice system, but how easy to guess is very sensitive to the black series. Already two defeats in a short time could spoil us all the fun. Before we get the experience, we suggest leave the game after a few wins. If the first defeat occurs, we definitively interrupt the game.
