          The Three Streets is a very interesting system and not difficult to learn. However, it requires some practice. 
          <a href="https://www.skyvegas.com/?aff=1197317075&open=login" target="_blank">Sky vegas roulette</a> let us play starting from 1 penny as a minimal spin-bet. It is really good place to test our strategies not spending too much money. We must divide our roulette table by 3 dozens. We will play betting on only 1 street withing every dozen.</p>

        <ol>
          <li> EXAMPLE: We watch roulette and check what has fallen out. Came up 14 (within 2nd 12). So we bet Â£1 on street - 13, 14, 15.
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-xl-6 mx-auto">
                <figure>
                  <img id="ftb-fort1" class="home-pic" src="images/roulette3streets1.PNG" alt="roulette" height="170" width="100%">

                </figure>
              </div>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li> This time came up 6 (within 1st 12). We bet then street - 4, 5, 6 
            and we leave chip on street 13, 14, 15.
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-xl-6 mx-auto">
                <figure>
                  <img id="ftb-fort1" class="home-pic" src="images/roulette3streets2.PNG" alt="roulette" height="170" width="100%">

                </figure>
              </div>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>Now came up 3 which is 1st dozen again but not in already covered 
            street. So now we add another chip to the street 4, 5, 6.
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-xl-6 mx-auto">
                <figure>
                  <img id="ftb-fort1" class="home-pic" src="images/roulette3streets3.PNG" alt="roulette" height="170" width="100%">
                </figure>
              </div>
            </div>
         </li>
          <li>We have 28 (3rd dozen). We bet now street 28, 29, 30 leaving of course all previous chips.
            
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-xl-6 mx-auto">
                <figure>
                  <img id="ftb-fort1" class="home-pic" src="images/roulette3streets4.PNG" alt="roulette" height="170" width="100%">
                </figure>
              </div>
            </div>

          </li>

          <li> Came up 15. It is on our street. We win! In the next step we take off from all streets so many chips as we had in winning street. In our case let's take off 1 chip from every dozen. We continue game with following table: 
            
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-xl-6 mx-auto">
                <figure>
                  <img id="ftb-fort1" class="home-pic" src="images/roulette3streets5.PNG" alt="roulette" height="170" width="100%">
                </figure>
              </div>
            </div>
          </li>

          <li>Our experience shows that the system loses its profitability if the total rate for 1 spin exceeds the basic rate 7 times. You should stop playing or change the system to another one.                             </li>   
         <li>
           SUMMARY: The Three Streets it's a fairly unknown system, and I'm sure many of you will be positively surprised. It can be a risky system, but we can protect ourselves by applying mentioned rate limit.
