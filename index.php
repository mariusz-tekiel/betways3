      <h1><font size="5">SPORT BETTING SYSTEMS</font></h1>

     <p>Welcome to the website presenting interesting and relatively low risk betting systems. We will focus on three sport disciplines such as <a href="football-betting-system-4matches4bets">football </a>,  <a href="horse-racing-betting-system-fibonacci">horse racing </a> and <a href="tennis-betting-system-favourite">tennis </a> .
       We will also describe selected <a href="roulette-strategy-martingale">European roulette </a>  strategies. 
       We are aware that there is no always winning system or 100% winning strategy. It is not easy to win money because we are dealing with professionals, odds setting masters. The probability works gently in the benefit of bookmakers. However, we can use certain systems to tilt the scales of victory in our favor.

       <p>We would like to show you how to analyze events and find the best of them for betting.  Some of the presented systems are widely known and described in the literature, some are modifications of already existing systems, but there are also completely original systems invented by us or our friends.</p>
