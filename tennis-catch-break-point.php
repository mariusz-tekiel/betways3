          We start with finding a tennis match in which the first set was very equalized. Lay odd on the winning player just after the end of the 1st set should be between 1.11 and 1.23.

        <ol>
          <li>We have found the match of Egor Gerasimov - Lukas Rosol. The 1st set has just ended. Lay odd on Gerasimov is 1.21, so this is a good moment for our movement.

            Now we are waiting for Rosol break point. If the servers are winning their games we should have some profit money on green all the time.

            SUMMARY: Catch the Break Point strategy is one the most exiting betting strategies. Unfortunately, it requires a lot of time and access to live broadcast. If we have these two things, and in addition we are fans of tennis, we can spend time very emotionally.
